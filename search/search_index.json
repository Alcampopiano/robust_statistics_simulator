The Internet has plenty of resources on these topics if you would like to learn more. What is bootstrapping? \u00b6 In the context of hypothesis testing and generally speaking, bootstrapping involves taking many random samples (with replacement) from the data at hand in order to estimate a sampling distribution of interest. This is in contrast to traditional methods which assume the shape of the particular sampling distribution under study. Once we have an emprically derived sampling distribution, obtaining CIs and p values is relatively straightforward.
