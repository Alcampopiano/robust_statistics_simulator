## What is bootstrapping?

In the context of hypothesis testing and generally speaking,
bootstrapping involves taking many random samples (with replacement)
from the data at hand in order to estimate a sampling
distribution of interest. This is in contrast to traditional methods
which assume the shape of the particular sampling distribution under study.
Once we have an emprically derived sampling distribution,
obtaining CIs and p values is relatively straightforward.
